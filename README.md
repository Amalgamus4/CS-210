# CS-210
SNHU Course CS-210 Programming Languages (C++)


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
      This program was designed to serve as an analysis tool for a hypothetical grocery store. It allows the user to search for an item
      to see the number of that item sold for the day, as well as list all items and their quantity sold and display a histogram of all
      items sold.
      
    What did you do particularly well?
      I was able to take what would have otherwise been a purely functional program and create a class based program that cleaned up the
      main file considerably. I also feel my input validation was very good.
      
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      I could improve the search functionality to be case-insensitive. This would make the code more efficient by allowing more freedom
      for the user to search the list. I could also use try/catch blocks to help with input validation and possible runtime errors.
      These changes would increase the program's security be reacting to runtime errors.
      
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
      I had a difficult time determining the best way to make this program object oriented, as I felt I could have written it with a purely
      functional paradigm. I had to instead decipher the best functions to make a memeber of the class and what data members to store in the
      class. I ultimately settled on creating a map to house the grocery list and quantities, and created member functions to act on that data.
      
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
      I can see many of the skills from this project being useful in other projects. Reading and writing to files will most surely be of value
      in my future projects and on into my career. I also feel that object oriented programming is a great paradigm to follow in many use cases.
      
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      I made this program adaptable by using a switch statement in the main loop, which allows for adding in new options very easily. The class
      based methods also allow for easy additions to create further analysis tools for the map data. I made the code readable by using descriptive
      variable and function names that describe exactly what the function does. I made the code maintainable by including many inline comments 
      to further explain each function's purpose so the intent is clear for future programmers.
